Simple multi episode renamer batch.
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

Have you ever been frustrated when loading a series into Sonarr or Plex, only to realize that episodes are missing because they are named, for example, 

The Garfield Show.**S01E01**.TRUEFRENCH.1080p.WEB-DL.H264-FTMVHD.mkv
instead of
The Garfield Show.**S01E01E02**.TRUEFRENCH.1080p.WEB-DL.H264-FTMVHD.mkv?

Well, there you go.
This script is here to fix that.

Just give it how many episodes you want (from 2 to 6) and fire the magic.
