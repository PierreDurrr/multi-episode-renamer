Simple multi episode renamer batch.
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

Have you ever been frustrated when loading a series into Sonarr or Plex, only to realize that episodes are missing because they are named, for example, 

The Garfield Show.**S01E01**.TRUEFRENCH.1080p.WEB-DL.H264-FTMVHD.mkv<br />
instead of<br />
The Garfield Show.**S01E01E02**.TRUEFRENCH.1080p.WEB-DL.H264-FTMVHD.mkv?<br />

Well, there you go.
This script is here to fix that.

Just give it how many episodes you want (from 2 to 6) and fire the magic.<br />
You can then use something like this to show them correctly in plex : https://github.com/blacktwin/JBOPS/blob/4580ca0bc686d5478225d10368e6e1e6af980c2c/utility/merge_multiepisodes.py <br />
